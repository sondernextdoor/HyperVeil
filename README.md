## HyperVeil

## Framework Overview

HyperVeil is a comprehensive SMM-based security framework designed with a multi-faceted approach to system memory access, protection bypassing, and stealth operation. The framework leverages System Management Mode's elevated privileges to operate beneath the operating system's security boundary, providing unparalleled access while maintaining operational security.

## Core Architecture

HyperVeil implements a four-tier architecture:

1. **Firmware Level** - SMM handler and UEFI components
2. **Kernel Level** - Driver for OS integration
3. **User Level** - Control interface and visualization
4. **Protection Layer** - Cross-cutting security mechanisms
